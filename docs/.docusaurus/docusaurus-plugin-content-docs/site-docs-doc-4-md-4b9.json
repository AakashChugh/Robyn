  "description": "In order to address multicollinearity among many regressors and prevent overfitting we apply a regularization technique to reduce variance at the cost of introducing some bias. This approach tends to improve the predictive performance of MMMs. The most common regularization, and the one we are using in this code is Ridge regression. The mathematical notation for Ridge regression is:",
