It is necessary to have R installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To [download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your preferred [CRAN mirror.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

There are four main script files within the [**code on Github**](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/master/source):
1. ***fb__robyn_mmm_(...)func.R:*** Where all the model functions are stored.
2. ***fb__robyn_mmm_(...)exec.R:*** Where the functions above are executed. This will be the main script you will be working with.
3. ***fb__robyn_mmm_(...)plot.R:*** Where the functions to plot results are kept.
4. ***fb__robyn_mmm_(...)optm.R:*** Where the optimiser functions reside.

Please **download** and **open** all of them in your R environment.
