It is necessary to have R installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To [download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your preferred [CRAN mirror.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

There are three main script files within the code:
1. **fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.func.R:** Where all the model functions are stored.
2. **fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.exec.R:** Where the functions above are executed. This will be the main script you will be working with.
3. **fb_nextgen_mmm_v19.plot.R:** Where the functions to plot results are kept.

Please **download** and **open** all of them in your R environment.
