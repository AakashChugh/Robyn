**Prophet** has been included in the code in order to improve fit and forecast time series by decomposing the data into trend, seasonality and holiday components.
**Prophet** is a Facebook original procedure for **forecasting time series** data based on a model where **non-linear trends** are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. More details can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/).
